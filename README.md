# Spatiotemporal-Prediction-Models-of-COVID-19-Spread

There are two spatiotemporal prediction models in this repository, which are used to predict the future risk of the COVID-19 in major cities of mainland China.

本仓库中有两个时空序列预测模型,其被用于预测2019新冠疫情在中国大陆主要城市的传播。

## Data Specification

The input migration data is provided by the Baidu Maps. In this project, we only provide mock data. Please use the open migration data released by Baidu Maps or contact Baidu to use Baidu data federation platform.

The input and output of the model are separately explained in their respective directories.

模型数据来自于百度地图迁徙数据，在本项目中我们仅提供mock_data，请自行使用百度地图公开的迁徙数据或者联系使用百度数据联邦平台。

模型的输入输出在两个模型各自的目录中有详细描述。


#### Acknowledgments and Disclaimer

The migration data for training and prediction are provided by Baidu-map during development. All the training and prediction processes are supported by the Baidu data federation platform and Baidu cloud. The models are independently designed and provided by Xiamen university. Baidu preserves an attitude of neutrality toward the prediction results of the model and has no responsibility for any related consequences. If you need to use migration data from Baidu Maps on the Baidu data federation platform, please contact lucliuji (WeChat).

该模型训练与预测所需之用户移动数据由百度地图提供。所有训练与预测过程，均通过百度数邦平台与百度云算力完成。该模型设计由厦门大学独立提供，百度对该模型的预测结果不持立场，对使用该模型预测所造成的任何后果不承担责任。如需要使用百度移动数据与数邦平台请联系：lucliuji（微信）
